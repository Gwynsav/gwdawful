# Welcome, stranger!

This is my awful configuration for the almighty **AwesomeWM**, featuring a 
user configuration file, repositionable bar and titles, dashboard,
notifications, screenshooting tools, multiple colorschemes, and more to
come, all done with Awesome's widget API!

Both results show on the pictures are achievable through changing just
a few variables in the `userconf.lua` file.

## Dependencies
### Mandatory
- [Awesome-git](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome) (duh)
- [mpd](https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD), 
[mpDris2](https://github.com/eonpatapon/mpDris2) and 
[playerctl](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl) (music player and actions)
- [Network Manager](https://github.com/NetworkManager/NetworkManager) (network signals)
- [Pipewire](https://github.com/PipeWire/pipewire) and
[Wireplumber](https://github.com/PipeWire/wireplumber) (audio signals)
- [shotgun](https://github.com/neXromancers/shotgun),
[slop](https://github.com/naelstrof/slop),
[xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip) (screenshots)
- [Roboto](https://github.com/googlefonts/roboto),
[Material Icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons) and
[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

### Optional (toggleable)
- [brightnessctl](https://github.com/Hummer12007/brightnessctl) (brightness signals)
- [bluez](https://github.com/bluez/bluez) (bluetooth signals)
- [upower](https://github.com/freedesktop/upower) (battery signals)

----------------------
This configuration also uses [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty),
[nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), 
[firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), 
[htop](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop), 
[lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf), 
and [thunar](https://github.com/xfce-mirror/thunar), 
by default, but none of these are hard requirements and you can 
easily change them in `userconf.lua`, although I still recommend **at 
least installing alacritty**.

## Installation

Install the dependencies listed above for your own distro. After that is
done, back your own configuration up, and you need only run:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Gwynsav/gwdawful.git ~/.config/awesome --recursive
```

And that is basically it, note that I do not provide configuration files 
for the programs used by default, this is because those are written in Nix
for my [NixOS rice](https://github.com/Gwynsav/nix-dots/tree/master/users/gw/config). 
You may still use them as reference but they don't exactly work if you're
not using Nix with Home Manager as is.
